== Overview

The Kafka connector implements the SME Connector API in order to provide native integration with Apache Kafka. This connector can be leveraged in the following ways depending on your use case:

* Ingest data by exposing an endpoint that transforms requests into messages that are published into an Apache Kafka topic.

* Stream your Kafka events to consumers thanks to web-friendly protocols such as HTTP or Websocket, and provide real-time integration capability to your ecosystem.

== Getting started

This guide will take you through creating a kafka endpoint, describe how to produce and consume messages and provide the details of all the configuration options available to you.

=== Prerequisites

* You must have installed the kafka plugin, follwoing the standard procedure for installing plugins detailed here (link)
* A basic understanding of kafka is required, this (link) is a good resource to get you started.

=== Creating a Kafka endpoint

You have the two following options when creating a Kafka endpoint:

* You can import an API definition using the Gravitee console, or
* You can create it via a `curl` command in API Management.

==== Importing an API Definition using the Console

Open the Kafka plugin in the console.

==== Creating a Kafka endpoint using API Management

Use standard API Management fucntionality to create an API endpoint (see here for more detail on creating APIs)
