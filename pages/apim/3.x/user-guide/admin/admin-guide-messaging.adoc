== Overview

You can use the APIM Console messaging feature to communicate with your users. You can send notifications about the entire APIM platform or about a specific API, and you can choose who to send them to.

You can send three types of notifications:

* *Portal* notifications
* *Email* notifications
* *POST HTTP message* notifications

You send APIM platform-level notifications with the *Messages* menu option:

You send API specific notifications with the API *Messages* menu option:

NOTE: You can only send API notifications to consumers subscribed to your API applications.

== Send portal notifications

When sending *Portal* notifications, you need to specify:

* the user link:/apim/3.x/apim_adminguide_roles_and_permissions[role^] to notify
* the title of the notification
* the text of the notification

Portal notifications are visible to all users belonging to the specified role in APIM Console, by clicking the bell in the top bar.

They are also visible in the notifications area of the system, if enabled for the browser:

== Send email notifications

When sending *Email* notifications, you specify the same information as for portal notifications.

APIM sends an email to all the users with the specified role who have an email address configured for their profile.

TIP: For more details on configuring user profiles, see link:/apim/3.x/apim_adminguide_users_and_groups[Users and groups^].

== Send HTTP POST notifications

When sending *POST HTTP message* notifications, you need to specify:

* HTTP headers
* whether a system proxy is to be used
* the URL to use for the HTTP message
* the text of the message

== Example

In this example we will see how to send a notification to all platform administrators.

. link:/apim/3.x/apim_quickstart_console_login.html[Log in to APIM Console^].
. Click *Messages*.
. Select *Portal Notifications*.
. Choose the *ENVIRONMENT* role to notify as *ADMIN*.
. Give the message a *Name* and enter the detail of the message in *Text*.
