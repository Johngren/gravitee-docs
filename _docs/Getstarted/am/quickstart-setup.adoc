= Access Management settings

This page gives a quick overview of setting up your Access Management environment in AM Console.

AM Console includes two types of settings, the *security domain settings* and the *organization settings*.

NOTE: AM Console is accessible to administrative users. You can manage users in the *Organization settings*.

== Environments

There are no settings for environments. An environment is only used to group security domains in a logical workspace. If you use the OSS distribution of AM, there is only a *default* environment, and the dropdown menu in the top left corner is disabled.

== Security domain settings

Security domains are used for managing your end users and their applications.
You can create sign-ins for your users by selecting multiple identity providers and building
your own custom authentication and authorization journey to match your brand requirements and identity.
