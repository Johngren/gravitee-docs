= Access AM Console

== Log in to AM Console

You access AM Console using the `GRAVITEEIO-AM-UI-HOST` URL created during installation.

NOTE: If you are running AM with our link:/Guides/AM/current/installation-guide/docker/images.html[Docker Compose image^], the `GRAVITEEIO-AM-UI-HOST` URL is `https://localhost/am/ui`.

During the AM installation process a default administrator account is created.
You can use this account to perform all the management tasks provided by AM, such as creating applications and identity providers, registering users and configuring security.

NOTE: By default, the login details for the AM Console administrator account are `admin / adminadmin`.

NOTE: You can change this default account in the AM Console by going to *Organization settings > Settings > Providers*.
The default account is created with the `Inline` identity provider.

To log in:
