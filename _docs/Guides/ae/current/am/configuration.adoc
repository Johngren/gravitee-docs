This page explains how to configure AM to work with AE.

- AM comes with an intuitive and easy to use integration with AE.
- AM provides a pre-defined and pre-configured list of alerts that simply need to be enabled or disabled.

NOTE: If you want to change some advanced settings, you can still update the relevant section of the AM API `gravitee.yml` file.

```yaml
alerts:
  alert-engine:
    enabled: true
    ws:
      discovery: true
      endpoints:
        - http://localhost:8072/
      security:
        username: admin
        password: adminadmin
   too_many_login_failures:
    name: "Too many login failures detected"
    description: "More than {threshold}% of logins are in failure over the last {window} second(s)"
    # the threshold rate in % to reach before notify. Default 10% of login failures.
    threshold: 10
    # the minimum sample size. Default 1000 login attempts.
    sampleSize: 1000
    # window time in seconds. Default 600s (10 minutes).
    window: 600
    # severity of the alert (INFO, WARNING, CRITICAL). Default WARNING.
    severity: WARNING

```

NOTE: This sample file gives an overview of how to fine-tune the too many login failures alert. You can find more information in the link:/Guides/am/current/user-guide/alerts/introduction.html[AM User Guide^].
