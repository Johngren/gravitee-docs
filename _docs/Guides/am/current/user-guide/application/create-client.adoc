== Configure the application

After you have created the new application, you will be redirected to the application's `Overview` page, which contains some documentation and code samples to help you start configuring the application.

== Test the application

The quickest way to test your newly created application is to request an OAuth2 access token, as described in link:/Getstarted/AM/setup-app.html[Set up your first application^].
If you manage to retrieve an access token, your application is all set.
