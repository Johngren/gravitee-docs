= Reset a user's MFA

If users lose their mobile device or can't use their authenticator application for any reason, they can ask the security domain administrator to reset their multi-factor authentication (MFA) devices.
The MFA factors associated with their user will be removed and MFA configuration screens (*Enroll* and *Challenge*) will be displayed during the next login attempt.

. In AM Console, click *Settings > Users*.
. Select the user and click the *Multi-Factor Authentication* tab.
. Click the remove icon image:icons/remove-icon.png[role="icon"] of the MFA factor you want to remove.
