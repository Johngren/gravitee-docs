== Overview

You can configure AM to register the device a user uses for authentication.
After a successful login attempt, AM adds the trusted device to the user account for a certain period of time and skips MFA as long as the
device is known.

== Configure AM to remember an authentication device

. Click the **Settings** tab, then click **Multifactor Auth**.
. Toggle on **Enable Remember Device**.
. Enter the details of the device identifier and the amount of time you want to remember the device (2 hours by default).
. Click *SAVE*.
