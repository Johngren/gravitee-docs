You can put in place a system of alerting to warn of any unusual and potentially dangerous events on AM authorization server that may be of interest to administrators or monitoring services.

AM integrates with the link:/ae/overview_introduction.html[Alert Engine^] product, a notification system to deliver messages using channels such as SMTP, Webhooks or link:https://slack.com[Slack].

Out of the box, some pre-defined alerts and notification systems (known as notifiers) are available to help you get started.
