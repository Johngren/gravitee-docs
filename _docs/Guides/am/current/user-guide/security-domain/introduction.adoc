= What is a security domain?
:page-toc: false

Security domains give you access to all AM resources such as applications, users, and identity providers.
They expose authentication and authorization URLs and provides analytics and reporting.

A security domain acts as the container for your applications.

The first task of setting up new authorization and authentication in AM is to create a security domain for your applications.
AM comes with a default security domain.
