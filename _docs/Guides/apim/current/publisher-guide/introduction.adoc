= Publishing APIs with APIM
:page-liquid:

The following sections describe the different ways you can create and configure an API using APIM Console.

For a quick introduction to creating an API in APIM, see link:/Getstarted/APIM/api-publisher-ui.html[Getting started with APIM^].

NOTE: From APIM 3.5.x, the recommended way to create an API is using the *DESIGN STUDIO* method described in the next section. For APIs created using this method, clicking the *Design* menu option automatically opens Design Studio.
Old API definitions or APIs created using the *PATH BASED* option must be migrated before you can update them in Design Studio. For more information, see the link:./design-studio/introduction.html[Design Studio Guide^].

== Policies

APIM is delivered with some default common policies, for standard APIM usage. You can also customize APIM by adding your own policies.
You can find a list of default APIM policies in the link:/Reference/policy/policy-apikey.html[Policy Reference^].

You can configure these policies in two ways:

* Using the API *Design* function:

* Using Design Studio (available from APIM 3.5.x):

NOTE: Which method you use depends on whether you have migrated your API design to Design Studio. You can migrate from the former *Design* function to Design Studio by following link:./design-studio/migrate.html[this procedure^].

== Ant notation

APIM frequently uses Ant notation for path matching:

* `?` matches one character
* `\*` matches zero or more characters
* `**` matches zero or more directories in a path
