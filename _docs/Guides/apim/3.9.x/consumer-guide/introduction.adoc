This section explains how to consume APIs using APIM Portal.

== Access

You can access APIM Portal without a connection (as an anonymous user), but to do anything with an API, you need to connect with a user account
and subscribe to some _plans_.

The default view in APIM Portal shows all the APIs the authenticated user can access (or only _public_ APIs for anonymous users).

The rules for accessing APIs is as follows:

* Public API: all users
* Private API: a user must be a member of the API (user, owner, primary_owner)
