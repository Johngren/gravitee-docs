In APIM, repositories are used for storing different types of data, the scope of each of which can be different.
For example, you can decide to store management data in MongoDB, rate limiting data in Redis, and analytics data in Elasticsearch.

You can configure separate repositories for each scope in the `gravitee.yml` file.
