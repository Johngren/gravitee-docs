This page explains how to enable APIM authentication using an APIM data source.
This type of authentication is required when you want to allow user registration.

You can define new users in APIM Console.

NOTE: Passwords are encoded using the BCrypt strong hashing function.

To activate this provider, all you need to do is declare it. All data source information is then retrieved from the Management Repository configuration.
