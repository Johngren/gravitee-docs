= Breaking changes in 3.10.4
:page-sidebar: false

NOTE: For all these breaking changes, the Migration Guide can be found link:/am/current/am_installguide_migration.html[here].

== JWK

Starting from v3.10.4 the `use` attribute (see link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517#section-4.2[rfc7517]) is defined for JWK exposed through the `jwks_uri` endpoint.

You can define this value when you configure the domain certificates ( *Settings > domains > mydomain > certiciates*.).

WARNING:  if the `use` attribute isn't defined, `sig` is used as default. Please update your certificates configurations if one of your certicate is currently used to decrypt/encrypt a JWT.
