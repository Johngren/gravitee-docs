== Extension Grants

Before v3.10.6, claims mapping for the extension grant only worked if you had user existence checks off.
Starting from v3.10.6, this behavior has changed. If you are using the extension grant with claims mapping and user existence enabled, you need to validate the content of generated tokens.
