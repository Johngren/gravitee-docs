title: Subscribe to an API with APIM Portal
---

These steps walk you through creating your first application and subscribing to your first API with APIM Portal. For a brief overview of how to set up your first API, see the **Publish your first API** sections of **Getting started with APIM**.

NOTE: APIM includes several ways to access and secure an API, as described in (link:/apim/current/apim_publisherguide_plans_subscriptions.html[API Publisher Plans and subscriptions]).
In this example, we will access an API using an link:/apim/3.x/apim_policies_apikey.html[API Key].
Only trusted applications can access the API data by requesting an API Key.
Let's see how to create the application and subscription. We'll generate the API key when we (link:/apim/current/apim_getstarted_consume.html[consume the API]) later.
