Organizations are increasingly using API management solutions to publish their APIs to external developers, internal developers and other
partners. API management can unlock the potential of their data and services and facilitate their transformation to OpenAPI and OpenData, extending their
digital platform offerings, opening up new communication channels and finding new customers.

Naturally, a growing customer base brings new challenges, such as:

* How to reduce the time taken to enroll new partners
* How to identify partners and manage their API consumption
* How to measure consumption from a consumer and/or producer point of view
* How to share existing APIs and how to discover them
* How to manage the API lifecycle, versioning, documentation, and so on

All of these challenges need to be addressed seamlessly for all APIs using a centralized tool. This is where Gravitee.io API Management comes in.

Gravitee.io API Management (APIM) is a flexible, lightweight, blazing-fast open source API management solution that gives your organization full control over who accesses your APIs, when and how. APIM is both simple to use and powerful, acting as a global solution for API management.

== APIM components

APIM is made up of four main components:

2. link:/apim/3.x/apim_overview_components.html#gravitee-components-rest-api[APIM API].
3. link:/apim/3.x/apim_overview_components.html#gravitee-components-mgmt-ui[APIM Console].
4. link:/apim/3.x/apim_overview_components.html#gravitee-components-portal-ui[APIM Portal].

[[gravitee-components-gateway]]
=== APIM Gateway
APIM Gateway is the core component of the APIM platform. You can think of it like a *_smart_* proxy.

Unlike a traditional HTTP proxy, APIM Gateway has the capability to apply <<apim_overview_plugins.adoc#gravitee-plugins-policies, policies>> (i.e., rules) to both HTTP requests and responses according to your needs. With these policies, you can enhance request and response processing by adding transformations, security, and many other exciting features.

[[gravitee-components-rest-api]]
=== APIM API
This RESTful API exposes services to manage and configure the <<gravitee-components-mgmt-ui, APIM Console>> and <<gravitee-components-portal-ui, APIM Portal>> web UIs.
All exposed services are restricted by authentication and authorization rules. For more information, see
the link:/apim/3.x/apim_installguide_rest_apis_documentation.html[API Reference] section.

[[gravitee-components-mgmt-ui]]
=== APIM Console
This web UI gives easy access to some key <<gravitee-components-rest-api, APIM API>> services.
<<apim_overview_concepts.adoc#gravitee-concepts-publisher, API Publishers>> can use it to publish APIs.
Administrators can also configure global platform settings and specific portal settings.

[[gravitee-components-portal-ui]]
=== APIM Portal
This web UI gives easy access to some key <<gravitee-components-rest-api, APIM API>> services.
<<apim_overview_concepts.adoc#gravitee-concepts-consumer, API Consumers>> can use it to search for, view, try out and subscribe to a published API.
They can also use it to manage their <<apim_overview_concepts.adoc#gravitee-concepts-application, applications>>.
